            <h2>Community</h2>
            <p class="medium-text display">We work with the refugee community to design and deliver innovative models of education.</p>
            <p>
              Mosaik Education’s vision is that refugees, asylum seekers, displaced people and conflict-affected communities
              are able to access, shape and lead the education they require for rebuilding their societies or for integration
              and success in new ones. We work towards this by engaging the refugee community to design and delivery of our
              programmes. We believe that such an approach is necessary because:
              <ul>
                <li>the inclusion of refugee communities in formulating programmes leads to better design in uncertain contexts</li>
                <li>participatory methods of design and pedagogy contribute to learning outcomes</li>
                <li>fundamentally, working in a context displacement and humanitarian need requires NGOs such as Mosaik to empower the refugee community</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>How does this translate into programmes? We design with refugees: Over 100 young refugees were involved in helping shape what we focus on and how activities are delivered. We create with refugees: Digital peer content is co-produced and delivered alongside our team of Student Ambassadors - refugee students volunteering with us and passionate about supporting their peers access university. We drawn on refugees’ experience for content: Our english programme uses ‘dialogic’ methods that focus on learner language in the class and draws on their own experiences. Finally, we work with local civil society organisations, who are led by refugees or host communities, to build partnerships that support their leadership and adaptation of programmes.</p>

            <h2>Technology</h2>
            <p class="medium-text display">Using technology allows us to reach the marginalised people and ensure programmes are scalable.</p>
            <p>All of our programmes leverage technology: the distribution of digital peer content through social media to reach thousands of viewers, online training for workshop facilitators, the use of mobile apps for english learning, crowdfunding to connect refugees with international networks of donors. This allows us to reach more people, and to connect with those who would otherwise find it difficult to access services.</p>
            <p>However, whilst we believe using technology has the potential to open up opportunities and reach marginalised communities, it needs to be locally relevant. The Connected Learning in Crisis Consortium, co-chaired by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), recommends that programmes should be adapted to local contexts, with on-site and online learning facilitation, and contextually relevant materials and pedagogy. Our model of designing with the community and partnering with local civil society organisations allows us to harness local insight for adapting our programmes to the local context.</p>
