            <h2>Dardachat – Guidance</h2>
            <p>
              Navigating higher education systems in unfamiliar countries isn’t easy. Dardachat is a platform fto share advice, support, and stories about accessing university.
            </p>
            <p>
              It’s co-created by a team of Syrian refugees and Lebanese students. Their experience makes the content relevant and accessible.
            </p>
            <p>
              It‘s broadcast through Facebook Live sessions and videos, followed by local meetups for students to discuss challenges and take action.
            </p>
            <p>
              This year six students in Lebanon and Jordan are leading planning and content creation. Since the start of 2019 Dardachat has reached 813 young people in Jordan and Lebanon.

            <h3>Batoul’s story</h3>
            <p class="">
              Batoul Outhman, a Student Ambassador in Lebanon, hosted a Facebook Live session on healthy eating and staying focused during Ramadan. Batoul reached out to a dietician to be a guest speaker, hosting a Facebook Live session on May 25, 2019.
            </p>
            <p>Batoul and Caroline’s video reached  330+ young people in Jordan and Lebanon.</p>

            <h2>English classes</h2>
            <!-- <p>
              Being able to speak English well is a barrier preventing refugees accessing higher education. It’s the primary language of study in local universities and online higher education programmes.
            </p> -->
            <p>
              There aren’t many opportunities to take part in quality language programmes. Paid-for courses are unaffordable and free courses tend to use out-of-date methods and irrelevant materials.
            </p>
            <p>
              We emphasise dialogue and draw on student experiences, making class content relevant to refugees’ lives. Because Mosaik classes don’t rely on expensive course materials they’re cheaper to scale across community centres.
            </p>
            <p>
              This year we aim to train local English teachers at 3 more community centres in Jordan and Lebanon.
