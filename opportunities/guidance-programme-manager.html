            <h1>Guidance Programme Manager</h1>
            <p>
              Today, only 1% of eligible refugees have access to higher education, compared to 36 percent of global youth. This limits their potential to become self reliant, integrate and contribute in their host communities and to help reconstruct their country to make it when they return home.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mosaik Education designs with the refugee community and leverages technology to support refugees accessing university through skills, guidance and finance programmes.
             </p>
             <p>
              Mosaik Education is working at the forefront of innovation in refugee education: we are seeking to bring about systemic change that empowers a community of refugees and civil society to shape and lead education through open education models, technology, participatory design and community leadership.
             </p>
            <h2>The role</h2>
            <p>
              We are looking for an exceptionally talented and highly motivated candidate to join our growing team to manage our Guidance Programme in Jordan and Lebanon.

Mosaik Education is also partnering and being advised by some of the world’s leading education professionals, researchers and innovators, who will also become part of your team and mentors in your professional development.
