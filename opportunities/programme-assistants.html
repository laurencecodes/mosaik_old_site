            <h1>Programme Assistants (Jordan and Lebanon)</h1>
            <p>
              Today, only 1 percent of eligible refugees have access to higher education, compared to 36 percent of global youth. This limits their potential to become self reliant, integrate and contribute in their host communities and to help reconstruct their country to make it when they return home.             </p>
            <p>
              Mosaik Education designs with the refugee community and leverages technology to support refugees accessing university through skills, guidance and finance programmes.
