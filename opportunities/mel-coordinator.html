            <h1>Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning (MEL) Coordinator (part-time, consultancy)</h1>
            <p>
              Today, only 1 percent of eligible refugees have access to higher education, compared to 37 percent of global youth. This limits their potential to become self reliant, integrate and contribute in their host communities and to help reconstruct their country to make it when they return home.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mosaik Education designs with the refugee community and leverages technology to support refugees accessing university through skills and guidance programmes. As a start-up charity, Mosaik Education is working at the forefront of innovation in refugee education: we are seeking to bring about a systemic change that empowers a community of refugees and civil society to shape and lead education through open resources, technology, participatory design and community leadership.
             </p>
